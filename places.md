# the unknown land
* the world in which we jam
* a war-torn world divided into city states.
* currently in a tenuous peacetime
* the roads are kept safe by the children of mache, but the wilds are untamed and dangerous
* many ruins dot the untraveled places of the world

# blackfields
* a town of middling size positioned on a prominent trading river

# the ohir-yenza (the sandsea)
* home to the sandstriders
* full of nightblooms, aka the cereus
  * very valuable among moneyed circles
